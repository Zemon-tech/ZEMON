- Cache expiration: 1 hour
- Cache is cleared on updates/deletes

### Analytics Tracking

- Tracks:
  - Page views (clicks)
  - Registrations
  - Daily view counts
  - Registration dates
- Data can be exported to Excel for analysis

### Best Practices

- Input validation using TypeScript interfaces
- Error handling with custom AppError class
- Redis caching for performance optimization
- MongoDB indexes for faster queries
- Authentication middleware for protected routes
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CORS configuration for security
