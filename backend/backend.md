## Community Features

### Ideas Section
- `GET /api/community/ideas` - Get all ideas (cached)
- `POST /api/community/ideas` - Create a new idea (requires auth)
- `PUT /api/community/ideas/:id/like` - Like/unlike an idea (requires auth)

### Comments Section
- `GET /api/community/ideas/:ideaId/comments` - Get all comments for an idea (cached)
- `POST /api/community/ideas/:ideaId/comments` - Add a comment to an idea (requires auth)

### Resources Section

- `POST /api/community/resources` - Add a new resource (requires auth)
- `PUT /api/community/resources/:id/like` - Like/unlike a resource (requires auth)

## Models

### Idea Model
```typescript
{
  title: string;          // Title of the idea
  description: string;    // Description of the idea
  author: ObjectId;       // Reference to User model
  likes: ObjectId[];      // Array of User IDs who liked
  comments: ObjectId[];   // Array of Comment IDs
  createdAt: Date;       // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;       // Last update timestamp
}
```

### Comment Model
```typescript
{
  text: string;          // Comment text
  author: ObjectId;      // Reference to User model
  idea: ObjectId;        // Reference to Idea model
  likes: ObjectId[];     // Array of User IDs who liked
  createdAt: Date;       // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;       // Last update timestamp
}
```

### Resource Model
```typescript
{
  title: string;          // Resource title
  description: string;    // Resource description
  resourceType: enum;     // PDF, VIDEO, or TOOL
  url: string;           // Resource URL
  addedBy: ObjectId;     // Reference to User model
  likes: ObjectId[];     // Array of User IDs who liked
  views: number;         // View count
  createdAt: Date;       // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;       // Last update timestamp
}
```

## Caching Strategy

The backend uses Redis for caching frequently accessed data:

- Ideas list is cached with prefix 'ideas'
- Comments are cached with prefix 'comments'
- Resources are cached with prefix 'resources'
- Cache TTL is set to 1 hour by default
- Cache is invalidated when related data is modified

## Authentication

All write operations require authentication using JWT tokens:
- Token should be included in the Authorization header
- Format: `Bearer <token>`

## Environment Variables

```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/community
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=optional
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

## Error Handling

All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Server Error

Each error response includes a message field explaining the error.
